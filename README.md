# A preferable & conventional look in Minecraft
Since Minecraft Java edition 1.14, when the texture update come true, the default textures changed utterly and become more breathing. 
But I still prefer to the classic ones because they incorporate inestimable neurogram of my childhood and companionship. 
As the game updates and updates, the classic texture seems antipathetic from the surrounding new-added blocks and items. 
I can't be loath to part with the ProgrammerArt. 
Hence, I made this resourcepack to adapt the new-added textures to the conventional ones. 
I altered some textures to acquire a cozier look in constructions. For instance, the diorite wall looks like quartz wall now! 
As a Japanese youth, I also appended some prevalent meme which is in vogue in East Asia. 
You can wipe out them easily by searching their names and expurgating them. Their names are corresponding to names in the game. 
Please uncompress the zip file before use, and don't tick the option to create a new folder when uncompressing it.
