# A preferable & conventional look in Minecraft

Since Minecraft Java edition 1.14, when the texture update come true, the default textures changed utterly and become more breathing. 
But I still prefer to the classic ones because they incorporate inestimable neurogram of my childhood and companionship. 
As the game updates and updates, the classic texture seems antipathetic from the surrounding new-added blocks and items. 
I can't be loath to part with the ProgrammerArt. 
Hence, I made this resourcepack to adapt the new-added textures to the conventional ones.
