After the texture update, almost all of the classic textures in Minecraft was replaced by the more relastic ones.
But some players prefer to the classic and simple texture of Minecraft and they use the resourcepack ProgrammerArt to cover the new texture.
As the game updates and updates, the classic texture seems different from the surrounding new blocks and items.
That's why I make this resourcepack.
